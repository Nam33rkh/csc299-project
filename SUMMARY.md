For this project, I had to build a personal knowledge management system, a task manager, and multiple command-line tools across several stages. Looking back at the whole process, I can see how much I relied on different modes of AI assistance, experimenting, troubleshooting, and learning how everything connects. In this summary, I will explain what I did, what worked well, what gave me trouble, and how I used AI tools throughout the development of tasks1 through tasks5. At the beginning of the project, I created a simple prototype task manager using JSON storage. I used Visual Studio Code and wrote basic commands for adding and listing tasks. At this stage, the code was very simple, but it helped me understand the requirements. I also talked to ChatGPT to get ideas for planning out the structure, because I wasn’t sure how to organize the code. This early discussion gave me confidence and helped me figure out what kinds of functions I needed. 

Before developing larger programs, I had to learn how to use git properly. This part actually took me longer than expected. I kept making mistakes such as pushing to the wrong folder, committing the wrong files, or having code only saved locally and not on GitHub. Throughout the project, ChatGPT helped me understand commands like git add, git commit, and how remote branches work. Although this caused some frustration, it was a valuable part of the learning process because now I am much more comfortable with version control. When I moved on to tasks2 and tasks3, my project became more structured. I added more features, improved searching, and started using better code organization. The biggest change in task3 was introducing pytest. I had never used automated testing before, so I needed help understanding how pytest works and how to write simple tests. ChatGPT guided me on where to place the test files, how to write assertions, and how to run the tests using uv run pytest. Once I got the tests passing, the project started feeling more professional and reliable. This was the first time I saw the benefit of automated testing being able to verify that my functions behaved correctly every time. 

Tasks4 was completely different from the earlier assignments. Instead of manipulating JSON files, I had to use the OpenAI Chat Completions API to summarize paragraph length descriptions. I had several issues: setting the API key, handling errors like “insufficient quota,” and fixing incorrect parameters such as max_tokens vs. max_completion_tokens. The AI helped me understand how the API works and how to update my code so it matched the newer versions of the library. Eventually, I got the program to loop through multiple paragraphs and print out short summaries from the model. 

Tasks5 was the biggest challenge. I had to clone a new repo, initialize spec-kit, generate specification files, and then build a whole new tasks manager from scratch following the plan. I used speckit to create the .specify folder and the templates. Then I wrote the specification, plan, and task list myself. After that, I implemented the full tasks5 CLI with adding, listing, completing, and deleting tasks, and I wrote tests to make sure they worked. I used AI throughout to fix bugs, guide file structure, and help me copy everything into the final project. 

Overall, I used AI in several different ways—planning, debugging, code generation, explanations, and troubleshooting git. Some mistakes slowed me down, like missing files, wrong directories, or API errors, but each time I learned something. By the end, I had a full project with prototypes, tests, specifications, agents, and working command-line tools. This project taught me more than any single homework assignment because it forced me to practice real development skills: organizing code, using version control, testing, debugging, and writing clear documentation.
